After 50, they are like onions.â âOnions?â the son asks. âYes. You see them and they make you cry.â This infuriated his wife and daughter.

After his 50s, itâs like a Christmas tree.â âA Christmas tree?â the daughter asks. âYes, dead from the root up and the balls are just for decoration.â
